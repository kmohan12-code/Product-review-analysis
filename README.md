Amazon Echo Review Sentiment Analysis
This project analyzes customer reviews for the Amazon Echo smart speaker. Using sentiment analysis with NLTK's VADER, the script determines the overall sentiment of the reviews and visualizes the distribution of product ratings.

Dataset
The dataset is a tab-separated file named Amazon.txt, which contains the following columns:

rating: Integer values from 1 to 5 indicating the user rating for the Amazon Echo.

date: The date when the review was posted.

variation: Describes the specific product variation (e.g., color, model, or fabric type).

verified_reviews: The text content of the customerâ€™s review.

feedback: A value of 1 (positive feedback) or 0 (negative feedback), indicating if the customer had a favorable or unfavorable review.

Sample data:

rating	date	variation	verified_reviews	feedback
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	Love my Echo!	1
4	31-Jul-18	Walnut Finish	"Sometimes while playing a game, you can answer a question correctly but Alexa says you got it wrong."	1
5	31-Jul-18	Charcoal Fabric	"I have had a lot of fun with this thing. My 4 yr old learns about dinosaurs, and I control the lights."	1
5	30-Jul-18	Heather Gray Fabric	"Love it! Iâ€™ve listened to songs I havenâ€™t heard since childhood!"	1
